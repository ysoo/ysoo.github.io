I went through a full stack web developer MOOC sometime during the school year of 2018 and created a website as part of the course's curriculum.

The website emulates Yelp. Users are able to create their own account, leave reviews and create their own campsites. It is created using MongoDB, Express and Node for the backend and HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for the front end.


<div class="img_row">
	<a href = "https://yelpcamp-ysoo.herokuapp.com"><img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/page.JPG" title="example image"/></a>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This is a page from Yelpcamp. Click on the picture to be redirected to a herokuapp hosting the website.
