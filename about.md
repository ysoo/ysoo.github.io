Hi there, my name is Yi Xian (pronounced EE-SEE-AN). I'm a student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I study Engineering Mechanics and Astronautics and Computer Science. I live in Madison, Wisconsin and will be graduating in December 2018. If you have a job opening that you think I'm a good fit for, hit me up!

This blog/ portfolio thing that you see here is a way for me to document things that I learn day-to-day. I found that when I work on different projects I tend to forget what I've done and lack the ability to reproduce the same results. Hence, I decided that I need some documentation regarding my projects.

Feel free to explore!

This website is build using Jekyll and hosted through Github pages. It is mostly written in Markdown, with a bit of HTML thrown in. The designer of this theme is Lia Bogoev's -folio theme with some tweaks of my own.
