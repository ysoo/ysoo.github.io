Understanding Low Mood

- When we experience lo wmood it may have been influecned by several factors from our internal and external world. But when we understand what those influences are, we can use that knowledge to shift it in the directiona we want it to go
- We have more over to influence our emotions than we thought
- When dealing with mood , it is not all in your head, it is also your body state, your relationships, your past and present, your living conditions and lifestyle. It is everything that I do and don't do, my diet, my thoughts, my movements and my memories. Not simply a product of my brain
