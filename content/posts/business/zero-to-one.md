There has been many a summary on these books. These are really popular books. I'm going to just write down my thoughts on what I think about these books, my takeaways, and action items I can take from reading these. 

I've always wanted to start my own business.

What important truth do very few people agree with you on? What do people agree on? 

I should aim for horizontal progress - taking things that work somewhere and make them work everywhere

Zero to one -> technology

Be contrarian. What valuable company is nobody building? 

Non monopolist exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller markets

Monopolist, by contrast disguise thier monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large markets

This book scares me. It thinks aout businesses in such a grand scheme. I am not ready for this as I am definitely not as ambitious. Monopolists can afford to think about things other than making money; non-monopolists can't. 

Monopolist create technology. Monopolist brings about invention. Monopoly drives progress because it promises years and decades of monopoly profits. 

Future cash flows. YOY revenue should be high. 

Proprietary technology
- Most substantive advantage
- Product is difficult or impossible to replicate
- 10 times better than it's closest substitute in some important dimension
Network effects
- Everybody is using it
Economies of scale
- Easy to scale
Branding

This resonates with me. Can you control the future? I can either expect it to take a definite form or treat it as hazily uncertain. If I treat the future as something definite, I can understand it in advance and work to shap it. But if I expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, I'll give up on trying to master it. 

I should find a field with definite optimists. 

I love this chart and I want to learn more about philosophy here. 

Definite Optimistic - Hegel, Marx
Indefinite Optimistic - Nozick, Rawls
Definite Pessimistic - Plato, Aristotle
Indefinite Pessimistic - Epicurus, Lucretius

We always need a plan.
