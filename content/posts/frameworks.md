### Goal
I want to outline and give some structure on how I want to write this blog. 

Also want to set up some goals on learning in my free time and outside of work. Work hasn't been very challenging and will likely not be challenging for a while. 

Notes and second brain. I have, at some point, been unable to stick to a second brain format. It is a habit that I really want to stick to. Somehow, it is  not possible to stick to it while working as I just have a scratch pad. So, I think the workflow should be scratch pad -> refine -> refine. Let's look into what those refining stages look like. 

My mom has a commonplace book and I used to have one when I was a student. After starting my journey as a full time person, I have not been doing that and I want to continue that. 

I learn very well through examples. 

CAPTURE
ORGANIZE - organize notes by actionality
DISTILL - progressive summarization - highlighting your notes again
EXPRESS - show your work

I think this blog should be the express part of my journey.

Capture any idea that resonates and put it in a note taking app.

The thing is, capturing information for the purpose of a blog post makes me digest it and go through it over and over again. 

I like the idea of this blog being a series of questions that I have and that it slowly answers all of them. 

For example, I have open questions on sentiment analysis, music generation and producing, different topics in tech that I have always been curious about and when and if I go through life and get little nuggets of information, I can put that up on this guy. 


Book reviews - I think I would love to pull this information from Robert Martin, whose blog "Reaonable Deviations" is an extremely well written and eloquent piece of work. That's to say that I really like this workflow which I am copying for myself. 

By the way, this is totally a plug for Robert Martin, who, by his own accord, also came to the same pathway conclusion totally by himself. At the advent of ChatGPT, one of my first ideas was to train a NLP model on my own notes to be able to harness the strengths of it to learn faster and better. I had a plan to have some form of GPT to spit out note cards in a question and answer way, since I definitely learn better
