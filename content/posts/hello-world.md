This is the first post in this.

I want to make a concious effort to write more and write better. Especially as I learn throughout my life and career, I have lost a lot of information to this brain of mine, who can't seem to hold on to anything.

I have a few grand aunts that happen to have Alzheimers. While 23andme claim that it doesn't run in my genes. With the rate that I don't remember things. I worry that one day I would lose all the collective and precious knowledge that comes in this noggin of mine.

In addition, I find that writing things down helps with the processing of information and emotions. The act of writing things down itself already helps with sending that knowledge into the hard drive of my brain instead of storing it in RAM. Plus, with the world of large language models, I don't even know why I would need to struggle at all in forming coherent paragraphs and sentences.

Anyway. I am hoping to start a habit of writing frequently.
