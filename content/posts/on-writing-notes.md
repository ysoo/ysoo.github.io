I don't know what the best workflow would be for structuring notes. I think the best way to structure notes would be the way that I can stick to. This might mean a lot of draft posts that are lying around everywhere. Here's the thing. I don't and I can't keep track of a certin things for a long time. I think I want to do content but I have the issue of perfection.

Couple problems. I get interested in a certain thing, I go all in, all interested in a single thing for 20 minutes, and then I get bored and I move along to the next thing. To curb that, I think I need
- A system that keeps me accountable -> having clear written out goals with clarity
- A system that allows me to pick up things where I left of before -> thought processes and notes that are easy to retrieve and understand

I think writing helps with all of that but I just need a good format on how to do it

That is, I think I need a proper workflow and QA checklist on how decent content is before releasing it to the world. 

What is  my internal QA checklist

The thing is, I think a lot of content online is really essentially crap. Is it quality? Is it engaging? Is it because things these days need to be in small bite sized pieces to ensure that people with short attention spans (aka, me) would be able to finish reading it without getting overly bored? 

I think the internal QA checklist would be
- Would I, personally, read this and find value in it? 
- Would I, personally, be bored of this within minutes? 
- Is the message that I am trying to convey, clear and concise?  
- Of course, in today's world, SEO.
