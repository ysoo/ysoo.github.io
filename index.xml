&lt;p>The goal is to learn about &lt;strong>Sentiment Analysis&lt;/strong> and how to perform it. As part of the fellowship.ai challenge, I want to write down what I have learnt through this process and what I can do to further learn more. The prompt in the challenge is really vague, with just a link to the IMDB Dataset that contains 50k movie reviews and that I should perform Sentiment Analysis on it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://ysoo.github.io/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Sep 2024 00:21:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ysoo.github.io/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is the first post in this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to make a concious effort to write more and write better. Especially as I learn throughout my life and career, I have lost a lot of information to this brain of mine, who can&amp;rsquo;t seem to hold on to anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a few grand aunts that happen to have Alzheimers. While 23andme claim that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t run in my genes. With the rate that I don&amp;rsquo;t remember things. I worry that one day I would lose all the collective and precious knowledge that comes in this noggin of mine.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
