      <description>The Goal The goal is to learn about Sentiment Analysis and how to perform it. As part of the fellowship.ai challenge, I want to write down what I have learnt through this process and what I can do to further learn more. The prompt in the challenge is really vague, with just a link to the IMDB Dataset that contains 50k movie reviews and that I should perform Sentiment Analysis on it.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in this.
I want to make a concious effort to write more and write better. Especially as I learn throughout my life and career, I have lost a lot of information to this brain of mine, who can&amp;rsquo;t seem to hold on to anything.
I have a few grand aunts that happen to have Alzheimers. While 23andme claim that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t run in my genes. With the rate that I don&amp;rsquo;t remember things.</description>
